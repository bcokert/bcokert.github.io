      <description>Guten Tag!
This weekend I build a little distributed message scheduler. I was recently motivated to learn PHP, and given a recent discussion at work, a message scheduler seemed the way to go. It fit the bill - not only would I be able to use php in a production-like setting, but I would also improve my fluency with distributed systems in general. It was also something I could get done in a reasonably short time - an important trait for an over-eager project starter like me.</description>
